Here is an analysis of how weather changes as you get closer to the equator.  To accomplish this analysis, data was pulled from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.

After assembling the dataset, Matplotlib was used to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude.  Factors examined included:  temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity.
